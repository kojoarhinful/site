I wanted a place where I could write down what I'm learning, share some personal thoughts, and just keep track of things that matter to me. It's been a bit of a journey, but guess what? I finally got it done ðŸ˜….
It feels good to have my own space set up after messing around with ideas for so long.


I want to give a huge thanks to [Ephraim Duncan](https://twitter.com/EphraimDuncan_) for his work on his portfolio. It's simple for my needs, just had to look at the UI and recreate some stuff myself (took me three days) and finally we are here.


So yeah, this is my little corner now! I'm excited to start using it more. Here's to writing lots of posts, maybe some random rants when I feel like it, and sharing lessons I pick up along the way. Looking forward to filling this space with all sorts of things.`;
