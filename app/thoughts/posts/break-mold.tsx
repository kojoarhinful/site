export const content = `When I first started learning to code, I wasn’t sure if this was really for me. I felt so overwhelmed, like I was pouring effort into something that just didn’t click. I kept asking myself, 'Is this my path? Am I even cut out for this?

There were days when I’d spend hours debugging a simple issue, only to realize I’d missed a semicolon or a closing bracket. It felt frustrating, and honestly, I doubted myself a lot. I’d see other developers building amazing projects, and I couldn’t help but compare myself to them. I thought maybe coding was for people who were naturally good at problem-solving, and I just wasn’t one of them.

But over time, something shifted. I started to enjoy the process.. the little wins, like getting a button to work or styling a page just right, gave me a sense of accomplishment I hadn’t expected. I realized that coding wasn’t about being perfect from the start; it was about persistence and learning through the struggle. I began to see patterns in the chaos, and slowly, things started to make sense.

Looking back, I’m glad I didn’t give up. Those early doubts taught me resilience and showed me that growth comes from discomfort. Coding has become a way for me to express myself, solve problems, and build things I never thought I could. I still have moments of doubt, but now I know they’re just part of the journey.

If you’re just starting out and feeling the same way I did, I’d say: give it time. It’s okay to feel lost it means you’re learning. The path might not always feel clear, but sometimes the best ones take a little wandering to find.

Thanks for reading!`;
