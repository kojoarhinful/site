export const content = `Back in senior high school, procrastination was my constant companion. It wasn't that I was lazy, I just kept telling myself "I'll do it later" while doing something else entirely. As a day student, I developed a habit of completing assignments at the last possible minute, sometimes even on the bus ride to school.

My learning pattern was inconsistent at best. Instead of studying a little each day, I'd only hit the books when I felt like "today is for learning." The irony was that I genuinely enjoyed learning, so much so that when I wasn't engaged in it, I felt like something was missing. Despite these habits, I was actually a good student. I actively participated in class discussions, asked thoughtful questions, and earned the respect of my teachers.

When I started learning to code, this same pattern followed me. I'd learn one concept today but keep postponing the next one I needed to tackle. I'd tell myself "later, later" until days or weeks had passed without progress. But eventually, I had a realization about the power of discipline.

Discipline became my turning point. I developed such a structured approach that if I didn't learn something new each day, I felt like I was falling behind. I discovered that setting clear goals and keeping them in focus provided the motivation I needed to keep grinding.

Do I still procrastinate? Of course, old habits don't die. But I've made a promise to myself to stop defaulting to "I'll do it later." Now, when I'm supposed to be doing something and I'm not, there's an uncomfortable feeling that pushes me back on track.

The journey from chronic procrastinator to disciplined learner wasn't easy, but it taught me that with the right mindset and consistent effort, we can break free from the cycle of postponement and achieve what we set out to do.

Thanks for reading!`;
