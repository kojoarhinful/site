  export const content = `Alright, so I've got this page up now. "Check mic" was me testing the waters, and it felt good to hit publish. But now that I'm here, I've been thinking what's the point of all this? Why am I even bothering to write stuff down and throw it out into the void?
  
    
  I guess part of it is just me trying to make sense of things. Life's messy, right? There's so much going on work, random ideas, stuff I'm learning, dumb things that annoy me and I've always liked writing as a way to untangle it all. Having this spot feels like a little base, somewhere I can drop my thoughts and not just let them float away. Maybe I'll look back in a year and see how far I've come. Or maybe I'll just laugh at how dramatic I was being. Either way, it's mine.
  
  Another part is that I kinda want to share. Not in some big "look at me" way, but more likeâ€¦ if something I figure out helps someone else, that'd be cool. I've spent so much time scrolling other people's posts, picking up bits of wisdom or just nodding along to their rants. Maybe I can toss something useful into the mix too. Or at least something that makes someone go, "Huh, yeah, I get that."
  
  And honestly? It's fun. Messing with this page, tweaking it, writing whatever pops into my head, it's a nice break from everything else. I don't have to overthink it or make it perfect. It's just me, a keyboard, and some thoughts. No pressure, no rules.
  
  So yeah, that's the point, I guess. It's a mix of selfish and not-so selfish reasons. A place to think out loud, keep track of my own mess, and maybe connect with a few people along the way. We'll see where it goes. For now, I'm just gonna keep writing and figure it out as I roll.`
